# Haunted House

This is the 3rd annual haunted house that my daughters (aged 7 and 8) and I put on for our neighborhood:

All of the props, except for the spectral projection, are Arduino controlled, attached to IR sensors and pushbuttons.  We love to do our best to scare our friends, and this year we got two of them really good.  This was the first year we introduced thunder and the IKEA bed coffin.
